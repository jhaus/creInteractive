WP Quick Deploy allows you to pick your favorite plugins and install them at once without hassle.

WP Quick Deploy is one of the easiest ways to get many of the top plugins loaded after a fresh install of WordPress. There's no need to manually hunt for them again, you can simply install them in bulk.

It also allows you to activate/deactivate, delete and update your plugins. Everything in one plugin!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I have problems installing new plugins =

WP Quick Deploy currently relies on file permissions set up correctly on your server, in order to write files to your plugin folder. Some servers require ftp login details to write the files and Plugin Central will support this option in the future.

= Can I suggest an feature for the plugin? =
